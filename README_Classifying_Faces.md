# PROJECT TITLE 
Classifying faces

## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
The project is based on a required assignment completed as part of a Machine Learning and AI certification. The goal of the project is to classify different faces and facial expressions using convolutional neural networks. More specifically, a first model aims to predict whether or not a person in a photograph is Tom Mitchell or not, while the second model predicts the facial expression of a person in a photo.

## DATA
The data used is the Faces dataset, is available from Tom Mitchell's website at CMU or the UCI ML repo:

## MODEL 
The model chosen is an adapted LeNet-5 architecture, as postulated by the assignment requirements. 

## RESULTS
The first model trained in just 121 seconds and achieved 100% accuracy, while the second model took several hours to train and achieved a respectable accuracy of 92%.
